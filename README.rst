rcfiles
#######

Contains my rcfiles / dotfiles, to be managed with `rcm
<https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm>`_.

This repo is designed to be cloned as a **submodule** of the `kiwami
repo <https://github.com/chuahou/kiwami>`_. For example, it contains
softlinks to outside of this repo.

For setup::

	$ cp rcrc ~/.rcrc
	$ rcup

The old dotfiles repo can be found `here
<https://github.com/chuahou/dotfiles-old>`_.
